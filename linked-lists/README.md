# Data Structure
Ok so this is a linked list constructor and it makes linked lists with 3 methods. the 3 methods are:

1) insertAtHead
2) find
3) remove

These are all pretty self-explanatory with insertAtHead serving as the method to add nodes to the list. If you type npm run test into the terminal all 6 of the tests will run
2 for each method. One of the tests makes sure they function while the other test checks for an empty list and throws an exception if they are.

To install this just clone the repo into wherever and do your npm i and you should be good.
Using the methods will look like this:

insertAtHead ---- <nameoflinkedlist>.insertAtHead(value) where value is what you want to be the value of the node
find ---- <nameoflinkedlist>.find(value) where value is what you want to be the value of the node
remove ---- <nameoflinkedlist>.remove(value) where value is what you want to be the value of the node
