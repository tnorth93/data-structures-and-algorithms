# Reverse an Array
This is the first whiteboarding challenge where I was to create a function that reverses the contents of a given array without returning a new array or using built-in JavaScript methods. I ended up using an additional array which I did not know was forbidden at the time, but I did not return that array according to the instructions.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

## Solution
![array_reverse](assets/array_reverse.jpg "array_reverse")

# Shift an Array
This challenge was to take 2 inputs, one array and one value, and insert the given value into the middle index of the array. This was pretty easy to do since we were allowed to use built-in methods and splice could do exactly what I needed.

## Challenge
Insert and shift an array in middle at index

## Solution
![array_reverse](assets/array_shift.jpg "array_reverse")
