# Reverse an Array
This is the first whiteboarding challenge where I was to create a function that reverses the contents of a given array without returning a new array or using built-in JavaScript methods. I ended up using an additional array which I did not know was forbidden at the time, but I did not return that array according to the instructions.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

## Solution
